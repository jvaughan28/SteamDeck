# SteamDeck
Items, code, and things I've found or created to make the Steam Deck better

Like most people that have purchased the steam deck I have been looking for tips and tricks on how to make it better. While I use the steam interface, I'm new to computer gaming and have used gamepass almost exclusively for games for the past 3 years. I am going to use this area to document what I have done to make both Windows and Steam games work better. If I use someones information I will alsoways like back to the original page/post to give credit.
